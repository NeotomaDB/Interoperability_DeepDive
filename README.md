# Examining Interoperability Among Databases

This project leverage xDeepDive to understand the intersection between existing paleo-data community resources such as the Neotoma Paleoecology Database, Global Paleofire Database or WorldClim. We use a list of terms compiled from researcher interviews that indicate likely sources of data used by researchers working in Holocene/Quaternary studies across a range of disciplines. Included in this set of terms are various tools associated with these different data resources.

The full list of terms and links used in the xDeepDive snippets search is in the [data folder](./data/merged_records.csv). We have 51 different resources identified from the interviews and 148 unique terms associated with these resources. Terms include URLs (e.g., `neotomadb.org` for the Neotoma Paleoecology Database), programming libraries (e.g., `rgbif` for the Global Biodiversity Information Facility) and alternate names, including initializations (e.g., APD for the African Pollen Database).

Using the xDeepDive snippets API we [search for these terms](./src/interop_dd.py) to build a large table of DOIs, text snippets and database terms. Initial testing shows this table to be quite large (>100k rows), in part because some resources have low specificity in their naming.

## Harvesting Snippets

The script to obtain text snippets is within the [src/interoperability_deepdive](./src/interoperability_deepdive) folder. These scripts:

1. Build the API URL -- [gdd_snippets](./src/interoperability_deepdive/gdd_snippets.py)
2. Page through the results list -- [gddURLcall](./src/interoperability_deepdive/gddURLcall.py)
3. Process the JSON response from the API -- [process_hits](./src/interoperability_deepdive/process_hits.py)

The resulting object is a `list` of `dict` items, structured to be submitted to a CSV file with the following structure:

| DOI | highlight | title | resource |
| --- | --------- | ----- | -------- |
| 10.1016/j.epsl.2018.10.016 | "identiÔ¨Åed using several publications (see supplementary information), the African Pollen Database, and" | The roles of climate and human land-use in the late Holocene rainforest crisis of Central Africa | African Pollen Database |
| 10.1016/j.crte.2008.12.009 | cm2 pe r year. The determination of 116 pollen taxa was made using the African Pollen Database reference | Climate and environmental change at the end of the Holocene Humid Period: A pollen record off Pakistan | African Pollen Database |

From this table we can manually examine records to assess match quality.

## Processing Results

To effectively build the network model for these resources we look to _co-occurrence_ of resources in publications. For example:

| DOI | highlight | title | resource |
| --- | --------- | ----- | -------- |


## Statistical Analysis

We care about several key measures:
